// Pure batching helpers for Auto Flow's classify step.
//
// These exist as their own module (rather than inline in main.ts) so they can be
// unit-tested without booting Electron — same reason docxFlowCards.ts is split
// out. main.ts owns the AI calls and the retry/split control flow; everything
// here is deterministic and side-effect free.
//
// WHY BATCHING EXISTS AT ALL: the classify handler used to send every card in
// one prompt, hard-truncated with `JSON.stringify(docs).slice(0, 60000)`. On a
// real case packet (a 1AC can carry 700+ cards) that cut the JSON mid-object, so
// most cards were never sent and what was sent was malformed. The reply then hit
// the output-token cap and came back cut off, failed to parse, and got laundered
// into `{ ok: true, placements: [] }` — a multi-minute wait ending in "Warroom
// AI didn't propose any placements" with no error shown anywhere.
//
// Run the tests:  npx tsx scripts/test-auto-flow-batch.ts
