// Handling input that's too big for one prompt.
//
// Three strategies, chosen by the user in Settings → Warroom AI behavior:
//
//   'ask'    — don't go past the limit. Cap and ask first (capForPrompt).
//              Whatever fits is sent in full; the rest is simply not sent.
//   'sample' — take a FAIR SHARE of every section instead of everything from the
//              front, and tell the model exactly what it's missing per section.
//   'passes' — read the whole thing across several calls, then a final call
//              writes the answer from those readings.
//
// The trade-off in one line: 'sample' keeps the real text but less of it;
// 'passes' covers everything but the final answer reasons over notes rather
// than the flow itself. See `LONG_INPUT_DILEMMA` below, which is the same text
// shown in Settings so the two can't drift.
